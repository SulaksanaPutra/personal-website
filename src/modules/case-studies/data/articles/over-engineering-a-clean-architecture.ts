Both were extracted from a large monolithic distributor platform (v1) and rebuilt as standalone SaaS applications after the company separated those business units.',
                    'I worked as the architecture designer and principal developer. I defined the base modules, coding standards, structural patterns, and overall code flow. The main goal was to avoid repeating the architectural chaos of v1, where business logic was scattered across controllers without clear boundaries.',

                    'The challenge was not performance or system instability, but architectural complexity. Coming from a Laravel background, and with most of the team experienced in PHP but new to Go, I adopted a strict layered architecture inspired by Laravel best practices.',
                    'I implemented clear separation between validation, handlers, business logic, repositories, and response formatting. The structure was clean and testable, but Go does not provide the same framework abstractions as Laravel. Without that support, each layer required explicit implementation, which resulted in significant boilerplate and repetitive code.',
                    'In practice, strict boundaries created friction. For example, validation was designed to occur only in the validation layer, but real-world logic sometimes required checks inside deeper layers. To maintain purity, we duplicated validation logic, which led to redundant queries and unnecessary complexity.',

However, since the system was stable and not breaking, architectural simplification was often deprioritized in favor of delivering new features.',
