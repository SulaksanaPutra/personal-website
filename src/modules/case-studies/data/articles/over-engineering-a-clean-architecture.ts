                answer: "We identified friction by looking for Functional Redundancy. For instance, in our stock-subtraction logic, we had a validation layer checking if stock existed, and a service layer that also had to 'catch and try' the same check during execution. We realized we were managing the same business rule in two places for two different reasons. By collapsing these, we didn't just remove code—we removed the risk of the validation and service layers ever falling out of sync.",

                answer: "Every architectural choice is a trade-off. While moving validation deeper technically 'leaks' concerns into the service layer, it was a necessary pivot for our system's scale. In a massive enterprise app, strict separation is a shield; in a leaner SaaS, it’s a hurdle. We consolidated our test suites so that the service layer tests handled both the business invariant and the validation, ensuring we didn't lose coverage, just complexity.",
