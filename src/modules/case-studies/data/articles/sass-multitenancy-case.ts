                    'Because the system was originally built and tested with only a single tenant in mind, a critical architectural flaw was quietly waiting for the day we actually succeeded in getting more users. Once multiple tenants began hitting the production servers concurrently, the system buckled under its own underlying assumptions.',

                    "It wasn't just a performance bottleneck; it was a fundamental breach of system integrity and user trust. Operational flows halted, and as the Senior Developer, I had to step in immediately and alone to stop the bleeding.",

                    'The architecture relied on an early `middleware` design that prioritized immediate simplicity over long-term concurrency. To switch tenants, the logic closed the previous database connection, opened a new one, and cached it in a global variable. At the time, it was a perfectly pragmatic decision—it worked seamlessly when the app was only serving a single tenant, and there was no visible reason to over-engineer the system before the scale demanded it.',
                    "In a highly concurrent Go application, this created massive race conditions. If a background `goroutine` or a concurrent request from `Tenant A` fired off while the global connection had just been overwritten by a new request from `Tenant B`, `Tenant A`'s data would simply be read from or written to `Tenant B`'s database. It was a ticking time bomb built on global state mutation.",

                    'Instead of thrashing connections open and closed, I configured the backend to establish persistent connection pools to all tenant databases upon startup, storing them in a globally accessible `map` in memory.',
                    'The crucial structural fix was utilizing `DI` properly. The middleware now identifies the tenant, retrieves the correct connection pool from the `map`, and explicitly injects it down the execution chain: from the `Request`, to the `Controller`, to the `Service`, and finally into the `Repository`. Every single request and background process was now hard-bound to an isolated database context.',

By eliminating the massive overhead of constantly tearing down and rebuilding TCP/DB handshakes for every request, the system became significantly faster.',

                    "Why didn't you just use `context.Context` to pass the database connection?",
                answer: 'I considered it. In the Go world, putting things in `ctx` is the "idiomatic" way to go. But when you’re staring at cross-tenant data contamination in production, "idiomatic" takes a backseat to "explicit." Using `ctx` felt a bit like a wild card—it\'s too easy for a developer to pull the wrong key or for the context to get lost in a deep call stack. By using direct `Dependency Injection` in the `Repository`—`NewRepository(db)`—I made the database a hard contract. It’s harder to mess up, and it made writing unit tests with `sqlmock` much more straightforward.',

                question: "Isn't a global `map` of connection pools a memory hog?",
                answer: 'Yes, we traded `RAM` for integrity. Each `sql.DB` is a pool, and keeping hundreds of them open simultaneously isn\'t free. However, for our current scale and the high traffic each tenant generates, the overhead of constant `TCP` handshakes and `DB` authentication was a much bigger performance killer than the memory footprint. In the early days, "simplicity" meant one global connection. Now, "pragmatism" means persistent pools. If we hit 1,000+ tenants, I’ll likely evolve this into a `Lazy Loading LRU` cache to evict inactive pools, but that time, stability is the priority.',
