This approach was designed for maximum efficiency; the application would accept a request, acknowledge it immediately, and handle the heavy lifting of WMS and FMS integrations in the background. From a stability standpoint, it was successful—as long as the system accepted the request, the user felt the app was working perfectly.',

Because the core business logic was encapsulated in background jobs, the user interface remained static once a request was accepted. In a logistics environment where API timeouts, credential expirations, or payload mismatches are inevitable, these background failures were silent.',
                    'A user might see a shipment marked as "In Process" indefinitely, unaware that the integration had failed minutes ago. This lack of feedback led to Data Drift: physical warehouse actions were stalled because the digital command had failed without an alert. We had built a stable engine, but we had failed to provide a real-time dashboard for its failures.',

This provided a lightweight, standard HTTP-based stream without the infrastructure overhead of managing full-duplex WebSocket connections.',

By segregating logs into dedicated database tables, we ensured that high-volume delivery logs didn\'t clutter the context of critical warehouse sync failures.',
