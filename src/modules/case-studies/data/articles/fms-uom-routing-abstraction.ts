                    'Twin FMS was designed as a SaaS-oriented miniservice to decouple delivery management from the legacy Twin v1 monolith. The objective was precision: once an order was loaded by the warehouse, the FMS would take over to manage the "last mile"—scheduling which orders went on which vehicles and in what sequence.',
                    'The vision was to build a semi-automated routing engine. We wanted to move away from manual dispatching toward a system that could calculate vehicle capacity and enforce First-In-First-Out (FIFO) logic with mathematical certainty.',

                    'To achieve automation, a routing engine requires rigid, calculable parameters like volume (m³) and weight (kg). However, we hit an immediate wall with operational habits. For decades, the business had operated using "Boxes" and "Pieces" as their primary units of measure (UOM).',
                    'While a "Box" sounds like a unit, it lacks physical consistency—a box of tissues and a box of canned goods occupy vastly different volumes. More critically, the business requirement to prioritize by Order Value rather than physical capacity introduced significant domain leakage. This forced financial data into an FMS that should have remained value-agnostic, coupling the logistics engine to ERP-level sales logic that was entirely outside its intended scope.',

                    'The business model was unmovable. Management refused to transition to volumetric measurements because "Boxes" were the language spoken by every driver and dispatcher in the field. If we forced a change to m³, we risked a total breakdown in communication between the office and the loading dock.',
                    'At the same time, we had to maintain the modular integrity of the FMS. As a SaaS product, it needed to remain decoupled from the sales modules of other systems, meaning we could not directly store or process financial data within the delivery logic.',

                    '`Normalized UOM Mapping`: We introduced "Calculable Units." This allowed users to continue using the term "Box" in the UI, while the system mapped each product to a decimal equivalent of a Standardized Volume. This enabled the routing engine to perform precise mathematical capacity checks in the background without forcing the warehouse staff to change their vocabulary.',
                    '`Decoupled Priority Logic`: To respect the business’s need for "Order Value" priority without contaminating the FMS domain, we implemented a metadata-driven flag system. The Sales system (ERP) would calculate urgency based on financial value and pass a simple priority label (e.g., High, Medium, Low) to the FMS. This kept the service modular and focused strictly on physical logistics, ensuring it remained "price-blind" while still respecting commercial priorities.',

We achieved a high-precision routing schedule that could finally predict vehicle capacity with minimal error. The frequent "schedule revisions" and manual overrides that plagued the manual system were significantly reduced.',
