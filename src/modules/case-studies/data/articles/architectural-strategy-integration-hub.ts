                    'Twin v1 was our monolithic distributor system handling everything from sales to warehouse management and delivery. When the business split its operations into separate warehouse and delivery entities, our tech company saw an opportunity. We decided to build a multi-tenant SaaS Warehouse Management System (WMS) and Fleet Management System (FMS) as isolated "miniservices."',
                    'The idea was to use our internal distributor as a test run—migrating operational flows out of Twin v1 and into these new SaaS products, while keeping Twin v1 as the core sales and finance point. To make this work, we needed seamless data synchronization across all three systems, handling hundreds of daily data points for an initial rollout of over 100 users.',

                    'Because the WMS and FMS were designed to eventually be sold as independent SaaS products, they were strictly encapsulated. To keep them synced with Twin v1, the initial integration was rushed: we relied heavily on direct Point-to-Point (P2P) API calls and webhooks.',
                    "This approach worked in theory, but in reality, it created a fragile, tangled chain of data. A flow wasn't just moving from A to B; it could jump from Sales to Warehouse, Warehouse to Delivery, and then back to Sales. If a network blip or logical error broke the chain at any point, the failure was silent. To find where the data was lost, we had to manually trace and cross-reference logs across three entirely separate applications. Debugging became a complex, time-consuming nightmare.",
