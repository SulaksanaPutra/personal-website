Originally designed strictly for operational flows like sales, warehouse management, and delivery, it was eventually forced to support heavy analytical reporting. Because reporting wasn't a priority in the early design, the system lacked a dedicated analytical layer. Instead, it relied on direct, real-time queries against the live production database for all reports.",
